**ArgoCD Installation using ArgoCD Autopilot on K3s Cluster**
This guide walks you through installing ArgoCD using ArgoCD Autopilot on a K3s cluster. ArgoCD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. ArgoCD Autopilot simplifies the process of setting up ArgoCD by managing repository bootstrapping.

**Prerequisites**
A running K3s cluster. Ensure the cluster is installed and working correctly.
kubectl installed and configured to interact with your K3s cluster.
GitHub account to host the GitOps repository.
A valid GitHub token with access to create repositories and push changes.

**Step 1: Install ArgoCD Autopilot**
Open a terminal on your VM or localhost that has access to your K3s cluster.

Run the following commands to install the latest version of argocd-autopilot:

VERSION=$(curl --silent "https://api.github.com/repos/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot/releases/latest" | grep '"tag_name"' | sed -E 's/.*"([^"]+)".*/\1/')
curl -L --output - https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-autopilot/releases/download/"$VERSION"/argocd-autopilot-linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar zx
sudo mv ./argocd-autopilot-* /usr/local/bin/argocd-autopilot


**Verify the installation by checking the version:**

argocd-autopilot version

The version should print out, indicating a successful installation.

**Step 2: Set Up GitHub Repository and Token**
Obtain a GitHub Token by following this guide if you haven't already.

Export your GitHub token and set up the Git repository you will use for ArgoCD:

export GIT_TOKEN=your-github-token
export GIT_REPO=your-repo-link
Replace GIT_TOKEN with your actual GitHub token and GIT_REPO with the URL of your Git repository.


**Step 3: Bootstrap the GitOps Repository**
With the repository and Git token set up, bootstrap ArgoCD into your cluster by running the following command:

argocd-autopilot repo bootstrap

This will deploy ArgoCD to your K3s cluster and initialize your GitOps repository.

Once the process completes successfully, you will see two important outputs:

**Admin Password for ArgoCD.
Port Forwarding Command to access the ArgoCD UI.**
Save these details for later use.

**Step 4: Exposing ArgoCD Service Using NodePort**
By default, ArgoCD is exposed using a ClusterIP service. To expose ArgoCD via a NodePort for external access, follow these steps:

Patch the ArgoCD server service to use NodePort:
kubectl patch svc argocd-server -n argocd -p '{"spec": {"type": "NodePort"}}'

Get the NodePort assigned to the ArgoCD service:
kubectl get svc argocd-server -n argocd

The output will show a NodePort under the PORT(S) column, typically in the range 30000â€“32767. For example:

**Access the ArgoCD UI by navigating to:
**
http://<NODE_IP>:<NODE_PORT>
Replace <NODE_IP> with the IP address of your K3s node and <NODE_PORT> with the actual NodePort (e.g., 32000).

**Log in using the following credentials:**

Username: admin
Password: (The password provided during installation)

**Step 5: Verify GitOps Repository Updates**
After logging into the ArgoCD UI, check your GitHub repository to verify that ArgoCD has successfully pushed the initial GitOps configuration files.

Ensure that all necessary ArgoCD resources (projects, applications, etc.) are visible on the ArgoCD dashboard.
